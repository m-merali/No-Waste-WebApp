                    We want to bring ease to recycling and part of that means educating about the many everyday
                    items that can be
                    recycled. This page is for those who would like to understand what, and how to recycyle said
                    items. You can
                    either search for items in the box, or press the images below.

                These can be easily recycled in most places. However, a mistake often made 
                is that people add items to recycling that are not recyclable. 
                Common mistakes involve leaving food residue on their cardboards.

                Paper requires more energy to produce than plastic. About 3 times as much. In addition, it is also generally heavier 
                to transport than plastic resulting in high vehicle emissions. 
                However recycled paper is far more energy efficient using 70% less when made than raw materials.
