                    We want to bring ease to recycling and part of that means educating about the many everyday
                    items that can be
                    recycled. This page is for those who would like to understand what, and how to recycyle said
                    items. You can
                    either search for items in the box, or press the images below.

            General plastics can be recycled. The simplest way to remember which plastics can currently be recycled is to 
            remember the following phrase: "If the item has a #1 or #2 
            on the bottom and the neck is smaller than the base, you can recycle it!" 
            Please don't put any of the following plastic items in your recycling bin: 
            motor oil containers, yogurt and margarine tubs even if it has a #1 or #2, or microwave trays. Reuse plastics 
            instead of throwing them away and purchasing new. Some shops allow to return worn out bags for new ones. 
            </p>

                Plastics last for hundred of years. Worst, they tend to be broken 
                down into micro plastics which can have devastating effects on marine life 
                and animals on top of those food chains. In addition, 
                it requires lots of fossil fuels to make and releases 
                tonns of pollutants in the air. This is compounded by the fact that 
                different plastics do not mix well and cannot be recycled. Plastics are also very easily 
                tossed away rather than recycled/reused and end up in the ocean.
