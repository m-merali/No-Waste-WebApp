                    <h21>ELECTRICAL ITEMS</h21>
                    <h22>Please note that recycling collections and facilities may be affected by the COVID-19
                        situation. Please check with your local authority for updates about services. <a

                    <p>Some local authorities collect small electrical items as part of their kerbside collection,
                        otherwise you can recycle these and larger items at selected retailers and at Household Waste
                        Recycling Centres.</p>
                    <p>Lots of items fall into this category including alarm clocks; CD/DVD players and game consoles;
                        small kitchen appliances such as kettles, toasters and blenders; personal grooming products like
                        hairdryers, straighteners, electric toothbrushes and shavers; garden tools such as lawnmowers
                        and shredders; other items such as lamps, torches, vacuum cleaners, phones, radios, TVs,
                        printers, cameras and smoke alarms.</p>
                    <p style="background-color:rgb(189, 255, 209);">It's easy to check if an electrical item, toy or
                        game is recyclable if it reached the end of its
                        working life. Simply ask the following questions and if the answer is yes, to any of these, it
                        is recyclable: </p>
                    <al>
                        <li>Does it have a plug?</li>
                        <li>Does it use batteries?</li>
                        <li>Does it need charging?</li>
                        <li>Does it have a picture of a crossed out wheelie bin on it?</li>
                    </al>
                    <h23>Can it be recycled if no longer usable?</h23>
                    <p>The best way to ensure your appliance has a long life is to follow the set up guidelines provided
                        by the manufacturer after purchase.</p>
                    <p>You can also register your item at <a
                            href="https://www.registermyappliance.org.uk/">registermyappliance</a> to ensure the
                        manufacturer can contact you if a free safety repair is ever needed</p>

                    <p>If you have an electrical item that is still in good working condition, you could consider
                        selling it, passing it on to someone else or donating it - some charity shops accept working
                        electrical items for resale.</p>
