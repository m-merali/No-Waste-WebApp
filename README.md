# No Waste ♻️ (Group 20)
## Project
Our group project works towards tackling UN Sustainable Development Goal 13, which is Climate Change. Our group idea is a recycling web application with the aim of reducing global warming. This can be done by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through recycling. The objectives of the app are:
* To educate people on what and how to recycle
* To allow people to easily search and find their local recycling centres
* To allow people to search and conveniently find their collection dates
